Through the polygons, get the median line in the contour and then extrapolate the line.
Given a centroid, get the euclidean distance then assign it to the lane that it is the closest to.

# get the saved polygons from the image

# get the median line in each polygon. 

# load the centroids and lines

# calculate the perpendicular distance from a vehicle to each line. Get the closest line and assign the vehicle to that road.

CS480 Project Proposal AI-Driven Image Analysis for Urban Traffic Insights

## Problem Statement
Traffic management in Singapore is critical, especially with the increasingly dense population and number of
cars on roads. Without efficient traffic management, it will lead to longer traffic congestion, which could bring
about many negative impacts for the Singaporean population. Examples of negative impacts include safety
risks, road rage and lowered productivity (Å evera, 2023). It is evident that traffic congestion would need to be
reduced as much as possible. Deploying manpower to manually observe traffic conditions for improvement
will serve as an arduous task with the large number of vehicles. Utilising computer vision on the other hand
could serve as a more efficient and effective solution to tackle the issue.

In this project, we strive to help our sponsor, Land Transport Authority (LTA), improve their operational
workflow and make better informed decisions via computer vision techniques. To do so, we will identify traffic
profiles using optimised traffic metrics that are useful to LTA. Traffic profiles, queue length, traffic density and
vehicle classes will be displayed on our application in a manner that is comprehensible, accessible and
useful to LTA.
